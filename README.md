# IRON-backend

This is the backend repo for the workout app project 'IRON'. This will contain code for a Python/Django API that queries an ElephantSQL database instance.

## Aims

General aims are outlined in the frontend repo. Additionally, the aim with this backend is to use Django to create the API to expand backend knowledge. I aim to write tests with mock data as this presented problems in the group project.

## Outcomes

An API that successfully queries the ElephantSQL database that returns the necessary data and response codes to produce a fully functioning app in combination with the frontend.

## User stories

1. As a user, I want my account details to be securely stored on the server so I can log in.
2. As a user, I want my app data to be stored on the server so I can access my data on different devices.

3. As a developer, I want comprehensive testing with mock data to ensure my API works as intended, and my API continues to function correctly following the addition of new features.
